Exercise 13.9. 
The “rank” of a word is its position in a list of words sorted by frequency: the most
common word has rank 1, the second most common has rank 2, etc.

Zipf’s law describes a relationship between the ranks and frequencies of words in natural languages
(http: // en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Zipf's_ law ). Specifically, it predicts that the frequency,
f , of the word with rank r is:
f = cr^-s
where s and c are parameters that depend on the language and the text. If you take the logarithm of
both sides of this equation, you get:
log f = log c - s log r
So if you plot log f versus log r, you should get a straight line with slope -s and intercept log c.
Write a program that reads a text from a file, counts word frequencies, and prints one line for each
word, in descending order of frequency, with log f and log r. Use the graphing program of your
choice to plot the results and check whether they form a straight line. Can you estimate the value of
s?

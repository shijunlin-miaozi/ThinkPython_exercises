# # Exercise 13.5. Write a function named choose_from_hist that takes a histogram as defined in
# Section 11.2 and returns a random value from the histogram, chosen with probability in proportion
# to frequency. For example, for this histogram:
# >>> t = ['a', 'a', 'b']
# >>> hist = histogram(t)
# >>> hist
# {'a': 2, 'b': 1}
# your function should return 'a' with probability 2/3 and 'b' with probability 1/3.

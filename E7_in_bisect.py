# Think Python 2nd Edition book_Ch10.Lists_p101

# Exercise 10.10. To check whether a word is in the word list, you could use the in operator, but it
# would be slow because it searches through the words in order.

# Because the words are in alphabetical order, we can speed things up with a bisection search (also
# known as binary search), which is similar to what you do when you look a word up in the dictionary
# (the book, not the data structure). You start in the middle and check to see whether the word you are
# looking for comes before the word in the middle of the list. If so, you search the first half of the list
# the same way. Otherwise you search the second half.

# Either way, you cut the remaining search space in half. If the word list has 113,809 words, it will
# take about 17 steps to find the word or conclude that itâ€™s not there.
# 
# Write a function called in_bisect that takes a sorted list and a target value and returns the index of the 
# value in the list if it's there, or None if it's not.
